# CS 101 Project: SpellChecker
## Spell Checker: The Goal of the Project
In this project, your job is to write an English spell checker. Your program should ask the user to
enter a line of text, which can contain multiple words, even sentences. Your program should
then proceed to parse the line into words, and eventually print out a line of text with all the
misspelled words replaced with corrected words.
So, for example if the input is:
There are sven people, of which three rae women.
The output should be:
There are seven people, of which three are women.
