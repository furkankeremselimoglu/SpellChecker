# CS 101 Project
### Spell Checker: The Goal of the Project
In this project, your job is to write an English spell checker. Your program should ask the user to enter a line of text, which can contain multiple words, even sentences. Your program should
then proceed to parse the line into words, and eventually print out a line of text with all the misspelled words replaced with corrected words.

So, for example if the input is:

There are sven people, of which three rae women.

The output should be:

There are seven people, of which three are women.
